62,"I respect owning up to it.  There's definitely concerns. I'm not saying there aren't. But even with all of those concerns, we're 12-5. We are playing at our floor, we will keep getting better as the season goes on. We have a new rookie head coach, a new superstar in town, and a bunch of new role players trying to find their place on the team (Jae and Marjon count since they didn't play much last season, AJJ, AJ, Beasley). Even with all of our struggles, we are by far the best fourth quarter team in the NBA this season. We are 2nd in the East. The way people talk about us it seems like we're 5-12 not 12-5. Jae is out. Khris has been out/on minutes restriction. Marjon missed some time. We still find ways to win. That's what you need to succeed in the playoffs, blowouts don't mean anything in the regular season.     With all that, don't you think calling for trades and for our coach to be fired in every game thread is ridiculous? We're not even a quarter of the way into the season yet, there is plenty of time to make a trade. Do we need to be talking about that CONSTANTLY in every game thread? These threads should be discussing what we see in the game, having some fun with other fans of the team. Bobby missed a few shots in the row; ""We need to get Bobby out of here"". Pat misses an open 3; ""Pat is so fucking washed, trade him yesterday."" Blazers shoot out of their minds in the first half (60% from 3); ""AG is the worst coach in the NBA, fire him"" even though we held them to 34 in the second half once they regressed anywhere close to their average.     Why are we here? Us fans have no say in trades, no say in personal decisions. There's literally no point in calling for everyones heads, and you look like a clown when you say shit like ""Trade Bobby he's trash"" when 1) We'd have no good backup bigs, 2) He helped lead the comeback in the second half 3) He was in the running for 6th man of the year last year and has been a quality contributor his entire time here, ON TOP of showing loyalty by taking a discount to sign with us. So why are we not just enjoying the moment? Can't we just enjoy the game? Shoot the shit with other Bucks fans? Ooh and ahh at the Giannis dunks and Dame time showing up every 4th quarter?

He has mostly been the ball handler in PnR, with some late game screens for Khris thrown in.   I think it’ll take Giannis some time to learn that new role, but I think he’s more than capable of thriving once he gets it figured out.  Also, I do think that Giannis will ultimately have to be a little more than that too. We still need him to grab defensive boards and charge down the floor and immediately put pressure on the rim. We need him getting deep seals and bending defenses by occupying dangerous positions near the rim. And sometimes, we will need him with the ball out on the perimeter to draw the bigger defenders out of the lane. Giannis is too good to simply be a PnR roll man. He can be super dangerous in that role, and I hope that he allows that to become a big part of the total Giannis package.  And yeah, I actually don’t think he’s a great matchup 1v1 with embiid (he fouls too much against a foul merchant) but I like that he is taking those assignments. I want to see him on Tatum, on Jimmy, on Jokic, on KD, LeBron, etc as the season progresses.

What this means, is that even when it does happen, he isn't prepared or doesn't trust that it was a good screen, so he hesitates.  In Portland, Nurk and Eubanks both set great fucking screens for him all the time, so he would come off and if the defender was even slightly backed off, he would rise up seamlessly, otherwise he would drive around him, or if they trap him, pocket pass to the roller.  Giannis and him should be an unstoppable two man game, BUT THEY NEVER DO IT.  Giannis slips 99% of the screens he goes to set.  Until this changes, it will be impossible for Dame to play to his strengths.     Giannis setting a good screen should mean either Giannis' defender has to hedge up to take the 3 away from Lillard, which means it is either a blow by from Dame, or a dump to Giannis at the 3pt line with runway and a running start, or a wide open shot for Dame if they sag off it to defend against Giannis.  THIS NEVER FUCKING HAPPENS.  Go back and watch how many times Giannis even TRIES to set an actual screen for Dame, and then look at how many of those are actually good screens.  I am 99% confident in most games you can count those on one hand.  Now go watch the last 5 minutes of what Denver just did to use to win this game.

961,"Hilarious seeing people blame the coach solely, ignoring how slow and lethargic some of our key players look.  These guys are not the same guys that won the chip a few years ago. They're older now, more prone to injury, that's life. The Bucks are the oldest team in the league, that's an undisputable fact. Time is not on our side, and we gotta make some moves if we ever want a legitimate chance at a chip. Fighting for wins against the Pistons, Spurs, Cavs ain't gon cut it come April when we face tougher competition.  AG is flawed, but we can't absolve the players of all blame. Eisenhower said ""Before a battle, planning is everything. Once the battle has begun, it's worthless."" A team with veteran players like this shouldn't be looking lost out there. They know exactly what they supposed to do and where they supposed to be, but truth is they lack the ability to meet those demands consistently.  When a team performs well you hardly hear anyone credit the coach, but when a team's playing like shit all of a sudden it's only the coaches fault.   It doesn't matter who the coach is, you could replace AG with prime Phil Jackson, Pop, or Erik Spoelstra and this current roster is still gonna under perform because our bench is ass and the only consistent player on this team is Giannis. Put AG in Boston and I bet you they'll still be one of the best teams in the league.  We can't hide behind our record either, we saw what happened last year.

1147,"I think every loss is good for some valid concerns. Here’s some I’ve seen from tonight:  * The Dame/Giannis pairing hasn’t been as smooth as expected. Lots of clunkiness that could be easily fixed throughout the season. There were a bunch of times where Dame had the ball and Giannis just lingered on the perimeter. Giannis on the perimeter is always going to clog the lane since his defender is gonna sink and help in the paint every time. Also, Giannis is still jacking up wide open threes. If he did a quick DHO to Dame when open instead, it would instantly turn the possession into an opportunity for Dame to score.  * Giannis is not an amazing roller as we expected. His decision making on the short roll has been pretty bad. Lots of travels too and indecisiveness. More reps will make him better.  * I believe that the Bucks should be trying to orchestrate the construction of the team to beating the Celtics. That would mean that guys like Portis could be a good trade piece for a more capable wing. With Dame being a below-average defender, you need to prioritize surrounding him with good defenders that can help out. Not confident at all that Jae or Beas could fill that role. Still a question mark if Marjon or Jackson can step up for it.  Not taking away much from the bad Dame game. It happens. But the spacing on offense looks awful, and I think it’s primarily due to Giannis. He needs to make sacrifices, adjust, and optimize his game to fit with Dame’s.",Loss,i think every loss is good for some valid concerns here’s some i’ve seen from tonight  the dame/giannis pairing hasn’t been as smooth as expected lots of clunkiness that could be easily fixed throughout the season there were a bunch of times where dame had the ball and giannis just lingered on the perimeter giannis on the perimeter is always going to clog the lane since his defender is gonna sink and help in the paint every time also giannis is still jacking up wide open threes if he did a quick dho to dame when open instead it would instantly turn the possession into an opportunity for dame to score  giannis is not an amazing roller as we expected his decision making on the short roll has been pretty bad lots of travels too and indecisiveness more reps will make him better  i believe that the bucks should be trying to orchestrate the construction of the team to beating the celtics that would mean that guys like portis could be a good trade piece for a more capable wing with dame being a below-average defender you need to prioritize surrounding him with good defenders that can help out not confident at all that jae or beas could fill that role still a question mark if marjon or jackson can step up for it not taking away much from the bad dame game it happens but the spacing on offense looks awful and i think it’s primarily due to giannis he needs to make sacrifices adjust and optimize his game to fit with dame’s,think every loss good valid concerns ’ ’ seen tonight dame/giannis pairing ’ smooth expected lots clunkiness could easily fixed throughout season bunch times dame ball giannis lingered perimeter giannis perimeter always going clog lane since defender gon na sink help paint every time also giannis still jacking wide open threes quick dho dame open instead would instantly turn possession opportunity dame score giannis amazing roller expected decision making short roll pretty bad lots travels indecisiveness reps make better believe bucks trying orchestrate construction team beating celtics would mean guys like portis could good trade piece capable wing dame below-average defender need prioritize surrounding good defenders help confident jae beas could fill role still question mark marjon jackson step taking away much bad dame game happens spacing offense looks awful think ’ primarily due giannis needs make sacrifices adjust optimize game fit dame ’,think everi loss good valid concern ’ ’ seen tonight dame/gianni pair ’ smooth expect lot clunki could easili fix throughout season bunch time dame ball gianni linger perimet gianni perimet alway go clog lane sinc defend gon na sink help paint everi time also gianni still jack wide open three quick dho dame open instead would instantli turn possess opportun dame score gianni amaz roller expect decis make short roll pretti bad lot travel indecis rep make better believ buck tri orchestr construct team beat celtic would mean guy like porti could good trade piec capabl wing dame below-averag defend need priorit surround good defend help confid jae bea could fill role still question mark marjon jackson step take away much bad dame game happen space offens look aw think ’ primarili due gianni need make sacrific adjust optim game fit dame ’,0,0,0

1515,"I could absolutely be wrong, but my gut feeling watching this team, and in particular Giannis, is that Giannis seems to feel like setting screens for Dame makes him the ""lesser"" player.  I think he views himself as a Lebron-type player, and Lebron rarely sets screens unless he is trying to get the mismatch for himself.  Problem is Giannis doesn't have as complete a game as Lebron does, so he isn't really a point-forward the way Lebron is.  I think AG played a big part of it though, at first I thought it was maybe to appease Giannis, but as time went on I think Griffin is just that bad of a coach.  I could spend maybe 8 hours of my life and compile tons of video comparisons on how the Bucks are using Dame that isn't working and how the Blazers have used him successfully in the past.  But, I don't get paid for that shit.  What is crazy to me is these coaches do.  It should be so god damn fucking easy.  I am hoping Doc and his staff see this shit, sit Dame and Giannis and Khris down and hash this stuff out.  Khris needs to be told he isn't the player he was anymore, and he is an infinitely worth ball-handler then Dame and should be used as one sparingly with Giannis.  Giannis needs to be told to set fucking screens.  Dame needs to be told to stop fucking deferring to god damn Bobby Portis on a fucking postup.  I would rather have Dame take a 35' fadeaway 3 than that.  The funny part is that Giannis is averaging his highest eFG% of his career, and whatever you want to say about Dame, that is 100% because of Dame just existing on the court.  The problem is Dame gets no benefits from Giannis being on the court if he isn't involved because Giannis has almost no gravity off the ball and seems to be really bad at finding Dame on the perimeter for a kick-out pass.  So to me, it is not surprising that Giannis is thriving and Dame is struggling.  I think this will change if/when they finally make Giannis and Dame play like teammates instead of two random dudes at the rec center that just takes turns doing shit in a pickup game.",Loss,i could absolutely be wrong but my gut feeling watching this team and in particular giannis is that giannis seems to feel like setting screens for dame makes him the lesser player i think he views himself as a lebron-type player and lebron rarely sets screens unless he is trying to get the mismatch for himself problem is giannis doesn't have as complete a game as lebron does so he isn't really a point-forward the way lebron is i think ag played a big part of it though at first i thought it was maybe to appease giannis but as time went on i think griffin is just that bad of a coach i could spend maybe 8 hours of my life and compile tons of video comparisons on how the bucks are using dame that isn't working and how the blazers have used him successfully in the past but i don't get paid for that shit what is crazy to me is these coaches do it should be so god damn fucking easy i am hoping doc and his staff see this shit sit dame and giannis and khris down and hash this stuff out khris needs to be told he isn't the player he was anymore and he is an infinitely worth ball-handler then dame and should be used as one sparingly with giannis giannis needs to be told to set fucking screens dame needs to be told to stop fucking deferring to god damn bobby portis on a fucking postup i would rather have dame take a 35 fadeaway 3 than that the funny part is that giannis is averaging his highest efg of his career and whatever you want to say about dame that is 100 because of dame just existing on the court the problem is dame gets no benefits from giannis being on the court if he isn't involved because giannis has almost no gravity off the ball and seems to be really bad at finding dame on the perimeter for a kick-out pass so to me it is not surprising that giannis is thriving and dame is struggling i think this will change if/when they finally make giannis and dame play like teammates instead of two random dudes at the rec center that just takes turns doing shit in a pickup game,could absolutely wrong gut feeling watching team particular giannis giannis seems feel like setting screens dame makes lesser player think views lebron-type player lebron rarely sets screens unless trying get mismatch problem giannis n't complete game lebron n't really point-forward way lebron think ag played big part though first thought maybe appease giannis time went think griffin bad coach could spend maybe 8 hours life compile tons video comparisons bucks using dame n't working blazers used successfully past n't get paid shit crazy coaches god damn fucking easy hoping doc staff see shit sit dame giannis khris hash stuff khris needs told n't player anymore infinitely worth ball-handler dame used one sparingly giannis giannis needs told set fucking screens dame needs told stop fucking deferring god damn bobby portis fucking postup would rather dame take 35 fadeaway 3 funny part giannis averaging highest efg career whatever want say dame 100 dame existing court problem dame gets benefits giannis court n't involved giannis almost gravity ball seems really bad finding dame perimeter kick-out pass surprising giannis thriving dame struggling think change if/when finally make giannis dame play like teammates instead two random dudes rec center takes turns shit pickup game,could absolut wrong gut feel watch team particular gianni gianni seem feel like set screen dame make lesser player think view lebron-typ player lebron rare set screen unless tri get mismatch problem gianni n't complet game lebron n't realli point-forward way lebron think ag play big part though first thought mayb appeas gianni time went think griffin bad coach could spend mayb 8 hour life compil ton video comparison buck use dame n't work blazer use success past n't get paid shit crazi coach god damn fuck easi hope doc staff see shit sit dame gianni khri hash stuff khri need told n't player anymor infinit worth ball-handl dame use one sparingli gianni gianni need told set fuck screen dame need told stop fuck defer god damn bobbi porti fuck postup would rather dame take 35 fadeaway 3 funni part gianni averag highest efg career whatev want say dame 100 dame exist court problem dame get benefit gianni court n't involv gianni almost graviti ball seem realli bad find dame perimet kick-out pass surpris gianni thrive dame struggl think chang if/when final make gianni dame play like teammat instead two random dude rec center take turn shit pickup game,0,0,1

1889,"I think there are a few really big takeaways from this game, and something I have mentioned before and anecdotally confirmed again tonight.  Dame makes Giannis better, but Giannis doesn't make Dame better.    Dame's gravity and the attention he commands opens up the entire court for Giannis, regardless of what they run on offense.  When Giannis isn't involved in the action when Dame has the ball, the paint clogs up and defenders run Dame off the 3, content to let him shoot mid-range.  Tonight, Dame shot ONE mid-range shot of 22, all his shots either coming in the paint or from the 3pt line.  THIS is the lethal Dame I have known on the Blazers the last few years.  This also resulted in Dame getting 13 FTA and him shooting 4-9 from the 3, 12-22 from the field.  Giannis, Dame and Doc need to have some fucking come to Jesus moments about Giannis setting screens, because when Giannis is on the court and not involved in the action with Dame, Dame suffers, and so do the Bucks as a team.  Especially come playoffs, defenses will be able to dismantle our offense if Giannis continues to refuse to set screens.  I think you have to give AJ Green most of PC's minutes at this point.  At least give it some run and see how it plays out.  Guy is constantly in the right spot, makes smart decisions, plays extremely hard on defense.  He deserves some real run.  Pat Bev is maybe the most underrated culture/tone setter in the NBA.  I literally think just his presence on the team has made Dame a better defender.  Dude is constantly recognizing players for big shots or good plays, was chest bumping and encouraging AJ Green after his huge 3 in the 4th.  Stuff like that matters.  Bobby looks great when playing within the offense.  Huge turnaround since Doc showed up as I think he explicitly told Bobby exactly what he wants to see from him and we are getting that now.  I think the biggest shot of the night happened near the 5 minute mark of the 4th.  Bucks had just pulled to with 3, 93-90, after clawing their way back from a big deficit.  Paul George sinks a 3 which can just be backbreaking sometimes to a team that has been fighting back into the game, putting them up 96-90.  Dame casually dribbled down the court, took a screen, and hit a little hesi-step back for 3, putting it right back into a one possession game, and started a 15-0 run over the next 3 minutes that put the game away.",Win,i think there are a few really big takeaways from this game and something i have mentioned before and anecdotally confirmed again tonight dame makes giannis better but giannis

But we were forced into resigning Middleton & Lopez. If we lost them we had no shot at contending. My hope is the Bucks have a bigger plan when Middleton and Lopez can be traded. I love Lopez I just think he not only is old as a turtle but he moves like one. I am good with trading Portis as well. I believe you trade players a year early over a year too late. We were a year late with Rodgers. A year early with Adams for the Packers for a example.  Middleton should never start again. He should be a 6th man. If this team wants to win it will build around Giannis and Dame and get some defensive players and if Middleton is on the team he comes in as a 6th man.   I think the championship this season was getting Dame and then Giannis resigning. It might of took hiring this L Bozo as my kids like to say with AG to get Giannis to resign.
