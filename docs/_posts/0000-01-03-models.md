#### Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression

- Capture unigrams and bigrams

#### Convolutional Neural Network

- Hyperparameters
  - filters = 48
  - kernel size = 4
  - number of dense layers = 40
  - learning rate = 0.001
  - dropout rate = 0.6

#### BERT

- MiniBERT selected (computationally efficient)
