"For those that didn't watch the game, Giannis only had 11 points because the Spurs were playing him well, Pop clearly didn't want any other Pacers situation, so Giannis just resorted to (correctly) finding the open man. They were double teaming him when he caught the ball/got downhill, so that's why he got a career high 16 assists. Realistically he could have easily ended up with 20+.  An older version of Giannis might have gotten frustrated and tried to plow his way through defenders, but why? He has all these good shooters (e.g. Dame, Khris, Beas) so why force the issue?  This game also showcases why the Bucks traded for Dame even more: If you can either prevent Dame, or prevent Giannis, you cannot do both. So, pick your poison.

"I am in no way comparing my situation/life to Dame or trying to give him an excuse, but I'm seriously starting to think there's stuff going on with him him outside of basketball. And not saying he has regrets about coming here  However I recently moved across the country myself. Grew up in WI, but in the past couple years, I started to hate the cold and snow, my job, was going thru a breakup with my long time GF, and didn't have family near me. The opportunity arose to move to Florida (save the political talk) and I took it. Fresh start, new job opportunities, warmer weather, and just a general chance to have a fresh start away from what was making me, or so I thought, miserable for the past couple years. Moved here, loved it at first, but after a couple months, you start to miss the familiarity you have with home. Simple things like where to eat, the roads you know to take, the people, and even the cold weather. You simply miss home and it's definitely made me more miserable some days than I ever was at home. It doesn't feel like home and you don't feel comfortable. Sever regrets some days.   Now let's look at Dame. Milwaukee was never THE place he wanted to go. Maybe,  after it was clear after he wasn't going to Miami, Milwaukee became the next best thing because of basically a job opportunity. Then he comes here and his former head coach leaves the staff, he goes thru a divorce, and has to get accustomed to whole new coworkers, a new city, way of life. Has to learn the city and all the things the comes with moving across the country, with little warning. It's not easy, no matter how much money you have.   For me the first month was great.

I'm getting there with him honestly. Early in the season I was against trading him because their bench is so bad and they have no backup bigs if Giannis/Brook are out. But he's been pretty bad when he's out there and isn't really contributing to their wins. The main thing he brings still is energy at home and there are times it can change the game. But they are less and less and he's too much of a liability on defense now that if he's not going to contribute more consistently on offense then I don't think he's worth playing much. And he's one of their only low-mid contracts (I think he's making like $12m?) That could be used in a trade with maybe a young guy as sweetener to bring back something. If they could find someone more defensive oriented like a bigger wing it might be worth doing. Still they are going to have to play a lot more small ball with Giannis at the 5 which is good for stretches but not ideal long term.,Loss,i'm getting there with him honestly early in the season i was against trading him because their bench is so bad and they have no backup bigs if giannis/brook are out but he's been pretty bad when he's out there and isn't really contributing to their wins the main thing he brings still is energy at home and there are times it can change the game but they are less and less and he's too much of a liability on defense now that if he's not going to contribute more consistently on offense then i don't think he's worth playing much and he's one of their only low-mid contracts i think he's making like 12m that could be used in a trade with maybe a young guy as sweetener to bring back something if they could find someone more defensive oriented like a bigger wing it might be worth doing still they are going to have to play a lot more small ball with giannis at the 5 which is good for stretches but not ideal long term,'m getting honestly early season trading bench bad backup bigs giannis/brook 's pretty bad 's n't really contributing wins main thing brings still energy home times change game less less 's much liability defense 's going contribute consistently offense n't think 's worth playing much 's one low-mid contracts think 's making like 12m could used trade maybe young guy sweetener bring back something could find someone defensive oriented like bigger wing might worth still going play lot small ball giannis 5 good stretches ideal long term,'m get honestli earli season trade bench bad backup big giannis/brook 's pretti bad 's n't realli contribut win main thing bring still energi home time chang game less less 's much liabil defens 's go contribut consist offens n't think 's worth play much 's one low-mid contract think 's make like 12m could use trade mayb young guy sweeten bring back someth could find someon defens orient like bigger wing might worth still go play lot small ball gianni 5 good stretch ideal long term,0

Giannis was peak efficiency and hit most of his FTs in the clutch. Dame shot poorly all game but kept the team alive with his assists and then some insane shots in the 4th. Brooks heater in the first kept the team in the game, even if he couldn’t hit shit afterwards. Pat and Bobby both played within themselves and extremely well at that. Pat bev was solid overall and is a better true PG than I thought. Jae is still cold off the injury but a great disrupter on D. Beas bad first half but turned it around on both ends of the court in the second half   Overall, despite some of the poor play, this team found a good baseline of play and that’s what won them the game. Similar to having bud who always coached a teams floor way up, doc looks to have done the same (one game sample I know).

"Here is my...theory...as to what is going on. I'm essentially playing devils advocate. I hope I am somewhat right.   Defense: I have a theory that the bucks ""know"" what works to stop teams. We are being experimental in these early games( the first 15-20 games don't really matter - ask Jimmy Butler) to see what might work if teams in the playoffs find ways around our defense that works (a drop defense like Buds scheme). Many,many times in recent playoff games for the bucks, teams knew how to beat our defense. Griffin and his staff are experimenting different ways to stop the ball so they know what might work when making adjustments in the playoffs. I mean a rookie head coach who's been an assistant for many years should at the very least know it's a horrible idea to have brook leave the paint to lead to an easy drive and score. I didn't even play high level basketball and could easily see Brook leaving the paint just  doesn't work.   Offense: this offense still scares me but it's my theory that Dame isn't even close to being ready. He did not work out all summer to stay healthy as he knew he was being traded. The bucks are figuring out ways to work without Dame. Everyone knows when it comes playoff time, you litterally have to stay glued to Dame ( like they are now). These first 15-20 games we are for one, letting Dame get his legs under him, and two, figuring out who our second option is going to be. Many times I see Dame doesn't even touch the ball on possessions. He might also be ""observing"" how Giannis, Brook, and Middleton work. He's played 4 games with those guys. The 3 of them have been together many years, its very hard to mold with vets who have played together a long time. He barely knows how these guys work together during certain possessions ( fast break, side outs, half court, etc).   It is way too early in the season to be worried. The first 15-20 games are experimental. Bud sort of did the same thing early on where he would play a lot of his bench to determine everyone's strengths, roles, and weaknesses.

Dame is understandably frustrated because they changed the rules from previous year and he’s not getting the calls or the shooting fouls in years past and he gets upset and misses a transitional period.

"I got downvoted into oblivion when I said that this trade is dumb, because the Bucks had no problem scoring in the previous playoffs. They couldn't stop the Heat from demolishing the Bucks with their shooting. If I remember correctly, their top 5 shooters shot like 47% behind the arc.  They lost a defensive anchor in Jrue. You lose a player who played the most pivotal role in defense, and now every player on the court has to make up for it, and it's sure as hell is difficult.  Dame on defense is what people think of Trae Young and Austin Reeves. And that cannot be fixed, because contrary to the popular belief, defense is not all about heart and effort. Defense requires a tremendous amount of skills, because the offense has the initiative of the attack 100% of the time (obviously). The defender has to adjust, react and predict every move, with his back turned against 4 other players, to be effective. And even if you got all those skills, you still need size and athleticism in order to cover the ground. That's why nobody plays defense in today's NBA, because it's TOO HARD. Unfortunately, Dame does not have any skills to play defense, or the size for it.  There's a reason why coaches like Pop will never give you a playing time, unless you can defend. The coach wants to see if you want to work on the hard stuff to succeed. There's a reason why the GMs line up to acquire players coached by Pop, who leaves the Spurs organization.  I also got clowned for saying that Dame is a one-dimensional player, that if his shooting doesn't get it going, he's gonna provide you nothing. Not only nothing, but it's actually worse than nothing because he's a turn-slide on defense.   I'm not even close to being an expert. I wasn't even a really high-level athlete. I was just a guy in my school years who was an athlete, who played many different sports to grasp the understanding of how a team sports work. Even a guy like me understands all this, I can't wrap my head around to why these ""experts"" in professional sports teams can't get a fucking clue.",Loss,i got downvoted into oblivion when i said that this trade is dumb because the bucks had no problem scoring in the previous playoffs they couldn't stop the heat from demolishing the bucks with their shooting if i remember correctly their top 5 shooters shot like 47 behind the arc they lost a defensive anchor in jrue you lose a player who played the most pivotal role in defense and now every player on the court has to make up for it and it's sure as hell is difficult dame on defense is what people think of trae young and austin reeves and that cannot be fixed because contrary to the popular belief defense is not all about heart and effort defense requires a tremendous amount of skills because the offense has the initiative of the attack 100 of the time obviously the defender has to adjust react and predict every move with his back turned against 4 other players to be effective and even if you got all those skills you still need size and athleticism in order to cover the ground that's why nobody plays defense in today's nba because it's too hard unfortunately dame does not have any skills to play defense or the size for it there's a reason why coaches like pop will never give you a playing time unless you can defend the coach wants to see if you want to work on the hard stuff to succeed there's a reason why the gms line up to acquire players coached by pop who leaves the spurs organization i also got clowned for saying that dame is a one-dimensional player that if his shooting doesn't get it going he's gonna provide you nothing not only nothing but it's actually worse than nothing because he's a turn-slide on defense i'm not even close to being an expert i wasn't even a really high-level athlete i was just a guy in my school years who was an athlete who played many different sports to grasp the understanding of how a team sports work even a guy like me understands all this i can't wrap my head around to why these experts in professional sports teams can't get a fucking clue,got downvoted oblivion said trade dumb bucks problem scoring previous playoffs could n't stop heat demolishing bucks shooting remember correctly top 5 shooters shot like 47 behind arc lost defensive anchor jrue lose player played pivotal role defense every player court make 's sure hell difficult dame defense people think trae young austin reeves fixed contrary popular belief defense heart effort defense requires tremendous amount skills offense initiative attack 100 time obviously defender adjust react predict every move back turned 4 players effective even got skills still need size athleticism order cover ground 's nobody plays defense today 's nba 's hard unfortunately dame skills play defense size 's reason coaches like pop never give playing time unless defend coach wants see want work hard stuff succeed 's reason gms line acquire players coached pop leaves spurs organization also got clowned saying dame one-dimensional player shooting n't get going 's gon na provide nothing nothing 's actually worse nothing 's turn-slide defense 'm even close expert n't even really high-level athlete guy school years athlete played many different sports grasp understanding team sports work even guy like understands ca n't wrap head around experts professional sports teams ca n't get fucking clue,got downvot oblivion said trade dumb buck problem score previou playoff could n't stop heat demolish buck shoot rememb correctli top 5 shooter shot like 47 behind arc lost defens anchor jrue lose player play pivot role defens everi player court make 's sure hell difficult dame defens peopl think trae young austin reev fix contrari popular belief defens heart effort defens requir tremend amount skill offens initi attack 100 time obvious defend adjust react predict everi move back turn 4 player effect even got skill still need size athletic order cover ground 's nobodi play defens today 's nba 's hard unfortun dame skill play defens size 's reason coach like pop never give play time unless defend coach want see want work hard stuff succeed 's reason gm line acquir player coach pop leav spur organ also got clown say dame one-dimension player shoot n't get go 's gon na provid noth noth 's actual wors noth 's turn-slid defens 'm even close expert n't even realli high-level athlet guy school year athlet play mani differ sport grasp understand team sport work even guy like understand ca n't wrap head around expert profession sport team ca n't get fuck clue,0

Trying some different looks in the early season is something I'd have loved to see from the coaches for the Blazers because, who knows, come the playoffs you might play a roster where it makes sense to come out to the perimeter and you need to know what that looks like early to fine tune it for when you might need it. Even to just change up the look you throw at a defense sometimes is really useful in later games of a series. During the regular season you can stick to your bread and butter but come the playoffs every matchup will need adjustments.  Obviously I don't have the context having just jumped on this bandwagon but the team seems to be playing pretty good! Its also just amazing to see Dame on a good team for once. Not only has he never played with another player the caliber of Giannis but he has never played with a center the quality of Brook, and the supporting cast is just better all around.  I've seen a lot of people in this thread say that the 1st half was kind of ugly but Griffin ran the bench for a *long* time in the 2nd quarter and they stuck around and carried for long enough for players to get a good rest.

">Man, I hate to say this, but even Giannis seems like he's unable to drive through a pack of defenders the way he did in the past, even last year. He seems, I don't know, maybe a bit slower or not as aggressive as he used to be?  He's too predictable, dominates the ball, and doesn't have a good sense of timing because he relies on his athleticism and size too much.  Go look at Jokic or Duncan and the way they play.  And how even though they're not the highest jumpers or quickest end to end, they play with sound fundamentals.  Give either the ball in the 4th quarter and they're not easy to predict for defenses.  They can post you up down low and get to the rim, fake from down low, fake from mid, Jokic can fake from 3, turn around J from the post, use glass, catch at the top of the key and shoot it, turn around from the mid-post, pass, set the screen, catch off the screen, pass out of the screen.  The offense is calm and steady with them, the role players are calm and steady.    Milwaukee has largely been predictable.  But a healthy Middleton who was hitting his peak as a player, and Jrue threw unpredictability into a predictable offense, and it worked to perfection for 1 season.  Watch the Bucks championship playoff run.  In a lot of those very tight games, Middleton made a lot of big buckets and gave that offense life.  Bucks fans always forget that, it's always Giannis this, Giannis 50 piece, blame Khris.  Down the stretch, Khris kept that offense alive, you don't score without him.",Loss,man i hate to say this but even giannis seems like he's unable to drive through a pack of defenders the way he did in the past even last year he seems i don't know maybe a bit slower or not as aggressive as he used to be he's too predictable dominates the ball and doesn't have a good sense of timing because he relies on his athleticism and size too much go look at jokic or duncan and the way they play and how even though they're not the highest jumpers or quickest end to end they play with sound fundamentals give either the ball in the 4th quarter and they're not easy to predict for defenses they can post you up down low and get to the rim fake from down low fake from mid jokic can fake from 3 turn around j from the post use glass catch at the top of the key and shoot it turn around from the mid-post pass set the screen catch off the screen pass out of the screen the offense is calm and steady with them the role players are calm and steady milwaukee has largely been predictable but a healthy middleton who was hitting his peak as a player and jrue threw unpredictability into a predictable offense and it worked to perfection for 1 season watch the bucks championship playoff run in a lot of those very tight games middleton made a lot of big buckets and gave that offense life bucks fans always forget that it's always giannis this giannis 50 piece blame khris down the stretch khris kept that offense alive you don't score without him,man hate say even giannis seems like 's unable drive pack defenders way past even last year seems n't know maybe bit slower aggressive used 's predictable dominates ball n't good sense timing relies athleticism size much go look jokic duncan way play even though 're highest jumpers quickest end end play sound fundamentals give either ball 4th quarter 're easy predict defenses post low get rim fake low fake mid jokic fake 3 turn around j post use glass catch top key shoot turn around mid-post pass set screen catch screen pass screen offense calm steady role players calm steady milwaukee largely predictable healthy middleton hitting peak player jrue threw unpredictability predictable offense worked perfection 1 season watch bucks championship playoff run lot tight games middleton made lot big buckets gave offense life bucks fans always forget 's always giannis giannis 50 piece blame khris stretch khris kept offense alive n't score without,man hate say even gianni seem like 's unabl drive pack defend way past even last year seem n't know mayb bit slower aggress use 's predict domin ball n't good sens time reli athletic size much go look jokic duncan way play even though 're highest jumper quickest end end play sound fundament give either ball 4th quarter 're easi predict defens post low get rim fake low fake mid jokic fake 3 turn around j post use glass catch top key shoot turn around mid-post pass set screen catch screen pass screen offens calm steadi role player calm steadi milwauke larg predict healthi middleton hit peak player jrue threw unpredict predict offens work perfect 1 season watch buck championship playoff run lot tight game middleton made lot big bucket gave offens life buck fan alway forget 's alway gianni gianni 50 piec blame khri stretch khri kept offens aliv n't score without,0

"What do you think of the low amount of turnovers from Chicago? Has that been a trend this season so far? Went to look at the Bucks turnovers and accidentally eyed Chicago's and was like ""what's he talking about, this is a super low amount- OH!""  EDIT: Looked up some stats. Looks like the Bulls only average 11ish TOs/game so far this season, only had 6 tonight but I didn't watch tonight so I don't know if that's on Bucks defense or if the Bulls were taking care of the ball/cutting out silly mistakes or what the ratio was between these things. But, they are #1 in the league in Turnovers, so not getting many on them should be expected.  The Bulls are averaging 17 Opponent TOs per game in their 10 games so far. So, while the Bucks got 15 turnovers, that's actually around what the Bulls have been forcing and what the Bucks are averaging.  Bucks are currently 18th in turnovers. Two possible contender teams that are lower than the Bucks are the Wolves and Suns. Wolves run a motion offense, and KAT seems to get like 3-4 TOs on his own through bonehead mistakes and charges. The Warriors run a motion offense too, which normally has high turnovers, but I think the addition of CP3 has lowered their turnover rate this season.  The other team is the Suns. This can be explained by Booker and Beal missing a lot of the early season and KD being in charge of the offense, he's not super reliable and tough defenses can force a lot of TOs out of him. And they really don't have other reliable ball handlers with Booker and Beal missing so much time.  I guess the takeaway is the Bucks have had the guy who should be their main ball handler either trying to find his way into the offense or is injured (Dame). And then, the other guy that should be handling the ball a lot besides Giannis and Dame is Middleton, who has been on a huge minutes restriction. Think the TO woes make sense in this context.",Win,what do you think of the low amount of turnovers from chicago has that been a trend this season so far went to look at the bucks turnovers and accidentally eyed chicago's and was like what's he talking about this is a super low amount oh edit looked up some stats looks like the bulls only average 11ish tos/game so far this season only had 6 tonight but i didn't watch tonight so i don't know if that's on bucks defense or if the bulls were taking care of the ball/cutting out silly mistakes or what the ratio was between these things but they are 1 in the league in turnovers so not getting many on them should be expected the bulls are averaging 17 opponent tos per game in their 10 games so far so while the bucks got 15 turnovers that's actually around what the bulls have been forcing and what the bucks are averaging bucks are currently 18th in turnovers two possible contender teams that are lower than the bucks are the wolves and suns wolves run a motion offense and kat seems to get like 3-4 tos on his own through bonehead mistakes and charges the warriors run a motion offense too which normally has high turnovers but i think the addition of cp3 has lowered their turnover rate this season the other team is the suns this can be explained by booker and beal missing a lot of the early season and kd being in charge of the offense he's not super reliable and tough defenses can force a lot of tos out of him and they really don't have other reliable ball handlers with booker and beal missing so much time i guess the takeaway is the bucks have had the guy who should be their main ball handler either trying to find his way into the offense or is injured dame and then the other guy that should be handling the ball a lot besides giannis and dame is middleton who has been on a huge minutes restriction think the to woes make sense in this context,think low amount turnovers chicago trend season far went look bucks turnovers accidentally eyed chicago 's like 's talking super low amount oh edit looked stats looks like bulls average 11ish tos/game far season 6 tonight n't watch tonight n't know 's bucks defense bulls taking care ball/cutting silly mistakes ratio things 1 league turnovers getting many expected bulls averaging 17 opponent tos per game 10 games far bucks got 15 turnovers 's actually around bulls forcing bucks averaging bucks currently 18th turnovers two possible contender teams lower bucks wolves suns wolves run motion offense kat seems get like 3-4 tos bonehead mistakes charges warriors run motion offense normally high turnovers think addition cp3 lowered turnover rate season team suns explained booker beal missing lot early season kd charge offense 's super reliable tough defenses force lot tos really n't reliable ball handlers booker beal missing much time guess takeaway bucks guy main ball handler either trying find way offense injured dame guy handling ball lot besides giannis dame middleton huge minutes restriction think woes make sense context,think low amount turnov chicago trend season far went look buck turnov accident eye chicago 's like 's talk super low amount oh edit look stat look like bull averag 11ish tos/gam far season 6 tonight n't watch tonight n't know 's buck defens bull take care ball/cut silli mistak ratio thing 1 leagu turnov get mani expect bull averag 17 oppon to per game 10 game far buck got 15 turnov 's actual around bull forc buck averag buck current 18th turnov two possibl contend team lower buck wolv sun wolv run motion offens kat seem get like 3-4 to bonehead mistak charg warrior run motion offens normal high turnov think addit cp3 lower turnov rate season team sun explain booker beal miss lot earli season kd charg offens 's super reliabl tough defens forc lot to realli n't reliabl ball handler booker beal miss much time guess takeaway buck guy main ball handler either tri find way offens injur dame guy handl ball lot besid gianni dame middleton huge minut restrict think woe make sens context,1

"Yea Brook Lopez should’ve just figured out how to aggressively trap on the perimeter, it had nothing to do with coaching!  Oh wait, that is just stupid.  If you don’t put your players in a position to succeed, or force them to do things they aren’t good at/comfortable with, you can’t be surprised when they underperform.  In the case of Dame, he is not a catch and shoot player, he is not an off-ball player.  If the Bucks keep trying to use him as such, he will continue to play like he has, inconsistently.  He is a rhythm player that needs to initiate the offense consistently in order to find his spots.  You can’t let him initiate the offense once every 3 possessions and expect him to magically be ok playing outside his comfort zone.  Just like you can’t expect Brook to magically be able to trap on the perimeter.  Griffin is a horrible coach.  Whatever fucking dumbass system he has (which I can’t see one other then my-turn-your-turn bullshit), he expects people to fit his system, instead of designing a system around the players he has.  This is the trademark sign of a bad coach.  Nate McMillan did this in Portland and he was a terrible coach.  A good coach puts his players on the best position to succeed by maximizing their strengths.  Until Griffin gets fired, this team won’t go anywhere.  It is frankly baffling to me that the Bucks trades for Lillard, all to treat him like a catch and shoot player and have him stand at the 3pt line doing nothing for 50% of the game.

Even with all of our struggles, we are by far the best fourth quarter team in the NBA this season. We are 2nd in the East. The way people talk about us it seems like we're 5-12 not 12-5. Jae is out. Khris has been out/on minutes restriction. Marjon missed some time. We still find ways to win. That's what you need to succeed in the playoffs, blowouts don't mean anything in the regular season.  With all that, don't you think calling for trades and for our coach to be fired in every game thread is ridiculous? We're not even a quarter of the way into the season yet, there is plenty of time to make a trade. Do we need to be talking about that CONSTANTLY in every game thread? These threads should be discussing what we see in the game, having some fun with other fans of the team. Bobby missed a few shots in the row; ""We need to get Bobby out of here"". Pat misses an open 3; ""Pat is so fucking washed, trade him yesterday."" Blazers shoot out of their minds in the first half (60% from 3); ""AG is the worst coach in the NBA, fire him"" even though we held them to 34 in the second half once they regressed anywhere close to their average.Why are we here? Us fans have no say in trades, no say in personal decisions. There's literally no point in calling for everyones heads, and you look like a clown when you say shit like ""Trade Bobby he's trash"" when 1) We'd have no good backup bigs, 2) He helped lead the comeback in the second half 3) He was in the running for 6th man of the year last year and has been a quality contributor his entire time here, ON TOP of showing loyalty by taking a discount to sign with us.  So why are we not just enjoying the moment? Can't we just enjoy the game? Shoot the shit with other Bucks fans? Ooh and ahh at the Giannis dunks and Dame time showing up every 4th quarter? No, because the game threads have been infested with doomers who think we are the worst team in history while we are FUCKING 12-5. I'm so done with it. We are living in the glory days, the MILWAUKEE BUCKS have two top 75 players of all time on their team, and we can't even enjoy it because of all these morons who likely started being a ""fan"" in 2021. If the team needs trades, Horst isn't going to Reddit game threads to listen to you idiots. He's going to do what he believes is best for the team, likely closer to the trade deadline, can we just trust him to do his job and we do our job just enjoying the entertainment?",Win,to the doomers and fan gms there are definitely concerns i'm not saying there aren't but even with all of those concerns we're 12-5 we are playing at our floor we will keep getting better as the season goes on we

We went with what Washington was giving us which was to pound them inside. We missed some wide open 3s that could have helped put it away (looking at you AJ Green). Giannis and Dame played fine together but honestly it wasn't that type of game. We didn't need to run a lot of pick and roll since it was much more effective to just get it to Giannis or Brook and let them create for themselves.  AJJ and Marjon are like yin and yang when it comes to instincts and that's what I think seperates them. Marjon looked indecisive when he got his opportunities tonight like he isn't sure if he is a jump shooter or a penetrator.

Bucks struggle every game. But they turn it on and become so clutch at the end. Kinda feels like the Kobe/Shaq Lakers. Where they look mediocre until they turn it on.  I sleep walk during the regular season as its boring and I just want it to be playoff time. The end of these games are amazing though.  I think this coaching staff is terrible.

Ok so that first half was basically not basketball and the 4th felt like they ran out of gas. So the Bucks played a single quarter of respectable basketball. Humiliating loss.

"    **EDIT, TLDR:** We can’t play our starters 36+ MPG and have an 8 man rotation in the regular season. It’s unsustainable. We need another person to eat up minutes and with how much Griffin was known to give players opportunity he needs to give someone like AJ Green minutes.  Edit: forgot we’re missing Jae.   AJJ and Khris were phenomenal tonight. Shoutout to them. AJJ played more minutes than Pat and Bobby.   Great games by both but I want to talk about the rotation and it only being 8 guys. I feel like guys are having to play more MPG this season than compared to the last few season and I don’t think that’s the best thing. I get why AG is doing it because it’s what works (playing your good players more minutes). However, I think you saw tonight that it can get a little bit exhausting/tiring for our guys. You can see it with there being an 8 man rotation.   It’s like sweeping your problems under the rug or just putting duct tape on something. We know we need another solid rotation player.   We either need AJ Green or MarJon or Livingston or even TyTy or someone to just eat up some of those extra minutes. It makes me think a trade is actually likely but I really don’t want to make another Donte for Serge Ibaka trade. I’d rather keep MarJon if that’s the case.   Was listening to an old pod with AG with Ryen Russello and he said you won’t know how good a player is until you actually play them and that’s why you need to play them and that’s coming from a guy who has to grind his way into rotations his whole career.  Not sure why he doesn’t play AJ Green because of that. An 8 man rotation is more suitable for the playoffs not an 82 game regular season.   Like our tomorrows opponent is Sacramento, I don’t see us being able to play high MPG vs them on a b2b especially with how much they run.",Win,edit tldr we can’t play our starters 36 mpg and have an 8 man rotation in the regular season it’s unsustainable we need another person to eat up minutes and with how much griffin was known to give players opportunity he needs to give someone like aj green minutes edit forgot we’re missing jae ajj and khris were phenomenal tonight shoutout to them ajj played more minutes than pat and bobby great games by both but i want to talk about the rotation and it only being 8 guys i feel like guys are having to play more mpg this season than compared to the last few season and i don’t think that’s the best thing i get why ag is doing it because it’s what works playing your good players more minutes however i think you saw tonight that it can get a little bit exhausting/tiring for our guys you can see it with there being an 8 man rotation it’s like sweeping your problems under the rug or just putting duct tape on something we know we need another solid rotation player we either need aj green or marjon or livingston or even tyty or someone to just eat up some of those extra minutes it makes me think a trade is actually likely but i really don’t want to make another donte for serge ibaka trade i’d rather keep marjon if that’s the case was listening to an old pod with ag with ryen russello and he said you won’t know how good a player is until you actually play them and that’s why you need to play them and that’s coming from a guy who has to grind his way into rotations his whole career not sure why he doesn’t play aj green because of that an 8 man rotation is more suitable for the playoffs not an 82 game regular season like our tomorrows opponent is sacramento i don’t see us being able to play high mpg vs them on a b2b especially with how much they run,edit tldr ’ play starters 36 mpg 8 man rotation regular season ’ unsustainable need another person eat minutes much griffin known give players opportunity needs give someone like aj green minutes edit forgot ’ missing jae ajj khris phenomenal tonight shoutout ajj played minutes pat bobby great games want talk rotation 8 guys feel like guys play mpg season compared last season ’ think ’ best thing get ag ’ works playing good players minutes however think saw tonight get little bit exhausting/tiring guys see 8 man rotation ’ like sweeping problems rug putting duct tape something know need another solid rotation player either need aj green marjon livingston even tyty someone eat extra minutes makes think trade actually likely really ’ want make another donte serge ibaka trade ’ rather keep marjon ’ case listening old pod ag ryen russello said ’ know good player actually play ’ need play ’ coming guy grind way rotations whole career sure ’ play aj green 8 man rotation suitable playoffs 82 game regular season like tomorrows opponent sacramento ’ see us able play high mpg vs b2b especially much run,edit tldr ’ play starter 36 mpg 8 man rotat regular season ’ unsustain need anoth person eat minut much griffin known give player opportun need give someon like aj green minut edit forgot ’ miss jae ajj khri phenomen tonight shoutout ajj play minut pat bobbi great game want talk rotat 8 guy feel like guy play mpg season compar last season ’ think ’ best thing get ag ’ work play good player minut howev think saw tonight get littl bit exhausting/tir guy see 8 man rotat ’ like sweep problem rug put duct tape someth know need anoth solid rotat player either need aj green marjon livingston even tyti someon eat extra minut make think trade actual like realli ’ want make anoth dont serg ibaka trade ’ rather keep marjon ’ case listen old pod ag ryen russello said ’ know good player actual play ’ need play ’ come guy grind way rotat whole career sure ’ play aj green 8 man rotat suitabl playoff 82 game regular season like tomorrow oppon sacramento ’ see us abl play high mpg vs b2b especi much run,1

"37 points in 25 attempts corresponds to 37/50 = 74% Not a hard calculation.  TS% formula basically does the same thing but it just has a fixed multiplier for the amount of possessions the Free Throw attempts correspond to which is based on historical data instead of just the game that was played.  Basically it's all about counting the ""extra"" free throws (technical free throws, and-1 free throws and 3rd free throws from a 3pt foul).  TS% can be inaccurate in some outlier cases. For example if out of the 16 free throws there were 6 ""extra"" free throws that would mean that the 16 free throws would only correspond to 5 possessions. Which means you get 37/46 = 80.4%. But the TS% remains the same as the formula is standard.  If you assume there are no ""extra"" free throws then you get the eFG% which is a bit bad for this reason (and always a little lower than TS%).
