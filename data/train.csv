"Hi! Relax guys :)   1. Our D was actually fine today. Improved. We lost this game on offense. Our starting line up missed EIGHTEEN threes today. We make two of those we win. Dame missed 3 FTs.   2. If there’s a trade that makes our D better without hurting the overall team, they’ll make it! So all good there. Also decent upgrade in Jae getting back.   3. Dame is going thru a divorce. It’s Houston. Do the math. We lose when he partied plain and simple. This is the reason HOU is great at home. Their strippers got them GYATS!!! You’re gonna take an L coming off a divorce with them booties. Just science.   4. We were down 20 at half on the road. We didn’t cave or fold we adjusted and fought. We were +16 to end. Not enough but good character. Beginning of year we’d lose by 25.  5. AG is doing well. He adjusts. He fixes stuff mid game. He does new lineups and tries new things. No coach with a backcourt D of Dame Beas, Cam, Pat, Marjon is going to be a top 12 D. With the roster he has, he is doing well and most importantly - IMPROVING.  6. You’re gonna have stretches where you’re 1-3 and it’s not popping. Rather now than VS Miami round one like last year. Like Kobe says, if they learn from it, grow from it and are fueled by it — losses will become valuable.  7. Giannis is not only playing better than his mvp seasons, he’s playing better than jokic and Joel’s too. He is easily the best player in the world. So when that person is on your team, that’s good!  On to the next. Get dame a curfew after all these hungover Ls, get him to lock in, and everyone keep getting better.

"> Dame should bring it up everytime  Hell, if nothing else, force feeding it will help him get his legs back physically and mentally, because it will also progress his way into a flow with this roster. Him and Giannis not being on the floor together most of the game is completely nonsensical. Him not being given command of the ball is criminally idiotic. If one thing isn't clear, then it needs to be, this team has badly needed a guy of Dame's caliber at the point. Do the obvious stuff over and over until it starts to gel. Something that will not happen if they are just flat not doing any of that. Hell, I'd much rather watch that being clunky with Dame getting his wind back, Giannis learning how to maximize his effectiveness, than whatever the hell it is they're doing right now. It should not be this hard. They're playing like the Packers, but it's not a team filled to the brim with rookies and second year guys. I also don't wanna hear about Griffin being a rookie head coach. The man is a former pro player and has been a pro coach for the last 15 years.

The Bucks either are too stupid or too stubborn to use him effectively, and it is currently wasting Giannis Prime and Dame's last shot at getting a ring.  Until Giannis realizes, at least on this current roster, he can't win alone, nothing will change.

Bud always gets the most out of his players.  I have been saying this for years on the forums. Bud got this team to overachieve every season. The reason for underachieving in the playoffs was because this team was never as good as there seeding.  Bud did have flaws. He was not good at developing younger players.  Bud had a system that put every player on this roster in the perfect spot for success. Bud couldn't get away from the drop defense because we would get destroyed with the roster we had.  Bud was not perfect. But he was a winner, respected, this team had no drama. He turned this franchise into a championship winner every season. The bar and standard's were set.  Everyone took Bud for granted. I think everything would of been fine with Nic Nurse. I expected the Bucks to make a move like this. I thought it was more of a new voice. This is a disaster. Not sure how this plays out this season. I don't think the Bucks have any chance at a championship. I will be curious to see if they let AG play out the season and who gets traded away. Will the Bucks trade Middleton, Lopez, Pat C, Portis and try to get some players AG likes and double down with him. Will Giannis or Dame demand out. Its going to be a crazy season but will have nothing to do with winning anything.  Too be honest I just see Dame and Middleton getting injured early and calling it a season.

His rebounds are even his points are only down 2pt's per/36 but his assists are up 1 ast per/36. So his net offense is equal to his 2021 season per minute. When Playoffs start he will be playing 40+ MPG. In playoffs. I have zero concern about our starting 5 it's the bench that could cost us everything.  Khris will avg 20/6/7.  Dame will avg 26/4/7  Giannis will avg 32/12/6  Brook will avg 15/6/2 and 3 Blocks (IK fans are giving him shit but if we trade him seasons over)  Beas will avg 14/5/2 shooting 40% in playoffs (Basically 2021 Playoff PC offensively)  Bench:  Jae Crowder only bench player that can be counted on for the playoffs if healthy. He's the only wing defender that manages a positive defensive rating this season even under our current turnstyle scheme we play. Bucks need 2 more bench players that can give positive defensive rating before playoffs and we're Gucci.  Bobby Portis should avg 18/10 problem is his defense is getting his ass played off the court limiting his minutes ergo his offense and rebounds because he's sitting. This year is the first season Bobby has been a net negative player since he's been a Buck. His BPM hasn't been this bad since he played for Chicago and traded midseason to Wizards during '18-'19 season. Before the trade Deadline either Bobby and PC must go or Adrian Griffin must go but these 3 guys can't work together period.  Pat Connaughton has finally got his 3pt percent up to a playable level at almost 38% but for the first time in his Bucks career he's a net negative defender. According to some sources he's one of the worst defenders in the NBA. Did Pat's defense really get that much worse compared to last season when he was playing hurt with a net positive defense or is our scheme just that bad? I'm sure the fact we don't have Jrue really hurts his net defensive rating but who knew it would turn our entire backcourt into a turnstile? In 2021 Pat DBPM was .05 and 1.5 in 2020. Last year while injured he had a .03 and this season healthy he's a -.04 first time he's had a negative defensive rating since 2018 when he played for Portland.  Ajax is a WIP but he's got a chance to be a big time glue guy to make our defense work. Offensively he's a prime PJ Tucker. Almost all his shots are either Corner 3's or Dunks and he's shooting 41% on Corner 3's. Ajax also has 5 more Dunks this season than Bobby Portis which is insane considering he's played less than half as many minutes as Bobby.  Marjon, AJ Green and Cam Payne will be of little help in the playoffs. Only one of the 3 that has a chance to be useful is Marjon if he somehow gets his groove back and stops panicking when he's under pressure.  I wish we would call up Tyty Washigton and see what he can offer. He's athletic and long PG that might be able to help our defense get headed in the right direction.

"We're almost halfway through the season so I think some critical discussion can be had about Dame.  He is incredibly lazy when he does not have the ball in his hands and it kills the team in some games.  He is most definitely not the main problem, but he is a big problem in transition defense/defense in general.  He slowly jogs back whether it's his turnover, a missed shot, or his teammates turnover.  His point of attack defense is shockingly bad.  His mid post defense is surprisingly not horrible though when opposing guards try to score that way.  Don't get me wrong, he is absolutely amazing when his shot is going.  The problem is, he needs to contribute when his shot IS NOT falling, which is inevitable in a long playoff series.  He needs to fully buy in to what a winning culture is, which Giannis and Khris have built in Milwaukee.  He just needs to show some sort of willingness.

"That series is by far my biggest what-if of the Bud era, but I think saying we had a clearly better team is pretty charitable to us. We were obviously a great team and certainly capable of winning that series and a championship, but we had flaws that can't solely be chalked up to Bud — even though his minutes management in that series was often baffling and our playoff half-court offense was our biggest recurring issue under him.  Obviously Toronto had the defensive personnel to form the effective wall on Giannis and take away what he did best on offense. Unfortunately, at that time, Giannis wasn't as equipped to handle it as well as he would be later. He was still developing as a playmaker, couldn't be relied on at all to hit the occasional jumper in the paint but outside the restricted area like he could during the championship run, and he had a bad tendency to try to beat the wall or great defenders like Kawhi by just stubbornly ramming into them until he got called for a charge or turned it over.  Certainly didn't help that Bledsoe wasn't much of a shooter and that the wall neutralized what he did best on offense as well, in addition to the fact that his decision-making in that series was horrible. Khris was also so hot and cold in that series. Both Giannis and Khris basically disappeared in crunch time in Game 6. And our 3-point shooting in that series was nowhere near where it needed to be given Toronto's defensive approach.  I would love to know how things shake out if Bud used Giannis-Khris-Brogdon lineups more in that series or if he spammed the Giannis-Khris PnR more to see if that helped free Giannis up a bit against the wall, but there were plenty of individual player failures in that series as well.",Win,that series is by far my biggest what-if of the bud era but i think saying we had a clearly better team is pretty charitable to us we were obviously a great team and certainly capable of winning that series and a championship but we had flaws that can't solely be chalked up to bud  even though his minutes management in that series was often baffling and our playoff half-court offense was our biggest recurring issue under him obviously toronto had the defensive personnel to form the effective wall on giannis and take away what he did best on offense unfortunately at that time giannis wasn't as equipped to handle it as well as he would be later he was still developing as a playmaker couldn't be relied on at all to hit the occasional jumper in the paint but outside the restricted area like he could during the championship run and he had a bad tendency to try to beat the wall or great defenders like kawhi by just stubbornly ramming into them until he got called for a charge or turned it over certainly didn't help that bledsoe wasn't much of a shooter and that the wall neutralized what he did best on offense as well in addition to the fact that his decision-making in that series was horrible khris was also so hot and cold in that series both giannis and khris basically disappeared in crunch time in game 6 and our 3-point shooting in that series was nowhere near where it needed to be given toronto's defensive approach i would love to know how things shake out if bud used giannis-khris-brogdon lineups more in that series or if he spammed the giannis-khris pnr more to see if that helped free giannis up a bit against the wall but there were plenty of individual player failures in that series as well,series far biggest what-if bud era think saying clearly better team pretty charitable us obviously great team certainly capable winning series championship flaws ca n't solely chalked bud even though minutes management series often baffling playoff half-court offense biggest recurring issue obviously toronto defensive personnel form effective wall giannis take away best offense unfortunately time giannis n't equipped handle well would later still developing playmaker could n't relied hit occasional jumper paint outside restricted area like could championship run bad tendency try beat wall great defenders like kawhi stubbornly ramming got called charge turned certainly n't help bledsoe n't much shooter wall neutralized best offense well addition fact decision-making series horrible khris also hot cold series giannis khris basically disappeared crunch time game 6 3-point shooting series nowhere near needed given toronto 's defensive approach would love know things shake bud used giannis-khris-brogdon lineups series spammed giannis-khris pnr see helped free giannis bit wall plenty individual player failures series well,seri far biggest what-if bud era think say clearli better team pretti charit us obvious great team certainli capabl win seri championship flaw ca n't sole chalk bud even though minut manag seri often baffl playoff half-court offens biggest recur issu obvious toronto defens personnel form effect wall gianni take away best offens unfortun time gianni n't equip handl well would later still develop playmak could n't reli hit occasion jumper paint outsid restrict area like could championship run bad tendenc tri beat wall great defend like kawhi stubbornli ram got call charg turn certainli n't help bledso n't much shooter wall neutral best offens well addit fact decision-mak seri horribl khri also hot cold seri gianni khri basic disappear crunch time game 6 3-point shoot seri nowher near need given toronto 's defens approach would love know thing shake bud use giannis-khris-brogdon lineup seri spam giannis-khri pnr see help free gianni bit wall plenti individu player failur seri well,1

Bad teams don't build up a giant lead because bucks have more talent, but every single game is a dog fight.  That's an indication of a bad scheme/game plan...especially for a team with this much talent.  Good teams will (and have) build up a giant lead against this scheme.  The Bucks do not have good perimeter defenders.  This aggressive closeout style allows g-league level guards to blow by their man because players like Dame, Payne, Khris, and Bobby are sprinting at the ball on the catch.

"The entire game or clutch time? Because I remember Dame and Giannis running PnR about 10 straight times to close out a team a few days ago, he’s also screened for Khris multiple times in clutch situations over the years so I’m not sure.

If Dame feels like Giannis doesn’t like to screen, why wouldnt he take the time to spam PnR with Lopez or Portis instead, especially when he’s running the bench unit alone? Wouldn’t Dame knowing that he’s a PnR player try to take advantage of anytime to perform it? If he was consistently running it with the others I’d agree but I don’t know tbh.

But they can both give you over 20 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists.  Murray will give you 30/10/10 in the finals.    Look how hard Murray moves without the ball, he'll cut, set screens for teammates, directing traffic.  Murray was making game winning defensive plays in the playoffs against LeBron, Jimmy Butler.

When they don’t have to respect the open shooter then they crowd the lane and double Dame.

Giannis- probably my hottest take of the night but he played like garbage. The fact that we have Dame & Payne two actual true PGs and yet he continues to try and initiate the offense from the perimeter and shoot threes.. Chuck said something that's absolutely so true on the TNT halftime show ""Giannis could make his life a lot easier if he ran without the ball"". Giannis needs to learn how to rim run instead of waiting to bring up the ball. The days of him being our ""PG"" are over it's Dame time.

I don’t think it’s too late at all for him, but i do think that we win more of these games with Bud, who seemed to be strangely tapped in sometimes even if it didn’t feel like it. “Play random” has so far proven a better strategy than what i’m watching us run.   There just doesn’t seem to be *that* connection with AG; but I’m also not in the locker room any more than I see on All-Access, so I could be wrong.

Negatives: it’s pretty clear why giannis wanted Griffin, he’s not going to actually coach him. 15 games in and he still doesn’t look for dame at all during fast breaks or his “put my head down and run at the rim” plays. He has not adjusted his game for his superstar teammate literally whatsoever.   During our run in the third quarter, Giannis killed any shot at a comeback. He’d grab the defensive board, look off dame clearly asking for the ball, slowly walk it up the court, and then spazz into the paint and turn it over. That killed any chance we had at a run.   Griffin played brook in drop against possibly one of the worst guys to do it against, porzingis. He left Bobby out there to get absolutely destroyed every minute he was on the court, and half our possessions are just “1 pass, ISO”.  Marjon and Ajax were highlights and griffin played them a combined 29 seconds.   There is no offense being run here. Griffins brain is stuck in the mid 2000’s when he played.

"Honestly, I am ok with this loss the way it happened.  Giannis wasn't good for his standards, Khris was very bad, especially on defense and whenever Giannis and Brook were out the game, the Celtics would score at will. Dame was bad to begin the game but very good in the end.  We can learn a ton from this game:  1) Dame and Giannis pnRs always lead to sth good on offense, both times they happened lol. DO THAT MORE OFTEN WTF !  2) Our players are slow defenders and are getting confused on switches. The Celtics are not even a super athletic team, why do you keep on overhelping ? Makes no sense. This is how we conceded a lot of points. On a positive note, rebounding was fine.  3) Marjon is really bad on his 1-1 matchups. He constantly loses his player and this leads to overhelping and messing up the whole rotation. When this happens, you either have to get him to guard slower players or have him sway towards the opponent's strong hand.  4) Bobby was bad all game, both sides. There was no point in keeping him in there for that long. AG really shit the bed with what he did there in the 4th. He not only increased the Celtics lead for no reason, but also cut down on the time our best 5 had to turn things around and as we all saw that really mattered in the end.  5) Some games require special handling, you could instantly tell that the team required Giannis and Brook at all times on defense.  I kept saying that throughout the game. When both would leave the floor the Celtics lead would increase every time.   I honestly had a lot of thoughts about the way we are playing throughout the game, but these are the most obvious ones. We can REALLY learn a lot from this one indeed.",Loss,honestly i am ok with this loss the way it happened giannis wasn't good for his standards khris was very bad especially on defense and whenever giannis and brook were out the game the celtics would score at will dame was bad to begin the game but very good in the end we can learn a ton from this game 1 dame and giannis pnrs always lead to sth good on offense both times they happened lol do that more often wtf  2 our players are slow defenders and are getting confused on switches the celtics are not even a super athletic team why do you keep on overhelping  makes no sense this is how we conceded a lot of points on a positive note rebounding was fine 3 marjon is really bad on his 1-1 matchups he constantly loses his player and this leads to overhelping and messing up the whole rotation when this happens you either have to get him to guard slower players or have him sway towards the opponent's strong hand 4 bobby was bad all game both sides there was no point in keeping him in there for that long ag really shit the bed with what he did there in the 4th he not only increased the celtics lead for no reason but also cut down on the time our best 5 had to turn things around and as we all saw that really mattered in the end 5 some games require special handling you could instantly tell that the team required giannis and brook at all times on defense i kept saying that throughout the game when both would leave the floor the celtics lead would increase every time i honestly had a lot of thoughts about the way we are playing throughout the game but these are the most obvious ones we can really learn a lot from this one indeed,honestly ok loss way happened giannis n't good standards khris bad especially defense whenever giannis brook game celtics would score dame bad begin game good end learn ton game 1 dame giannis pnrs always lead sth good offense times happened lol often wtf 2 players slow defenders getting confused switches celtics even super athletic team keep overhelping makes sense conceded lot points positive note rebounding fine 3 marjon really bad 1-1 matchups constantly loses player leads overhelping messing whole rotation happens either get guard slower players sway towards opponent 's strong hand 4 bobby bad game sides point keeping long ag really shit bed 4th increased celtics lead reason also cut time best 5 turn things around saw really mattered end 5 games require special handling could instantly tell team required giannis brook times defense kept saying throughout game would leave floor celtics lead would increase every time honestly lot thoughts way playing throughout game obvious ones really learn lot one indeed,honestli ok loss way happen gianni n't good standard khri bad especi defens whenev gianni brook game celtic would score dame bad begin game good end learn ton game 1 dame gianni pnr alway lead sth good offens time happen lol often wtf 2 player slow defend get confus switch celtic even super athlet team keep overhelp make sens conced lot point posit note rebound fine 3 marjon realli bad 1-1 matchup constantli lose player lead overhelp mess whole rotat happen either get guard slower player sway toward oppon 's strong hand 4 bobbi bad game side point keep long ag realli shit bed 4th increas celtic lead reason also cut time best 5 turn thing around saw realli matter end 5 game requir special handl could instantli tell team requir gianni brook time defens kept say throughout game would leav floor celtic lead would increas everi time honestli lot thought way play throughout game obviou one realli learn lot one inde,0

"100% on board with you, Dame’s been a volume guy his whole career. I wasn’t a big fan of how Dame would get the ball one possession, then the next possession Giannis would bring it up and run a PnR himself. Keep letting Dame do it! It helps him find his rhythm. Not too worried about Giannis since he’s gonna always get his, especially in transition.   Agreed about the Giannis screens as well, they were much more impactful tonight. Hard screens give Dame much more space to pull up or get by his man. It made no sense for Giannis to set a half-assed screen and pop right back to the perimeter for the ball.   Getting the Dame/Giannis 2-man game is a huge good sign for us. Still think they should move Bobby/Pat for a ~$20mm guy that can play POA defense, switch, and hit the occasional team.

Dame is a PG version of Middleton pre injury. Giannis is a black hole on offense. Gets his points off fast breaks and up tempo baskets but he has no skill set or offensive moves to score the ball in the half court. Giannis is not a player that should ever have the ball in a half court offense.  The NBA season is long so you can't say judge a team early on.  What I can say is Giannis is a black hole and the lowest IQ offensive player in the NBA. I think coach AG is a puppet and Giannis runs the team. I have no doubt Stotts had a offensive that ran through Dame and Giannis is a selfish player despite pretending not to be. And forced Stotts out.  Is there anyone in the Bucks organization that can change Giannis's and get him to buy into playing within the offense. We will find out.  I would dare Giannis to get Dame and then leave. Giannis would end up being the most disliked player in the NBA. If he stacked another team it wouldn't be any better than the Bucks and everyone would see him for what he is.   Giannis is the most fake selfish player in the NBA. I don't think Giannis is a team player on offense. He has not improved in 3+ years. I don't think Giannis is smart enough to win multiple NBA championships.   Imagine if Bucks fans start liking Dame more than Giannis.   Also Middleton has been cooked for years. He is a dead corpse.

"Like I said in the game thread, I’m sure there’s a ton of flaws you can find in griffins coaching and he’s probably not the right guy for the job, but when dame looks this bad, there’s no point in a deep analysis. It’s like trying to diagnose the flu in a gunshot victim.   I have watched every game of dames career since at least 2014. I have never ever ever, seen him play this terribly. The only time that came close was the year he had abdominal surgery, and I knew from game 1 that year that he wasn’t healthy while the blazers sub called me a crazy hypochondriac.   That’s what it looks like. He’s slow, his footwork is completely off, his positioning on shots is bad, he is completely drenched and gassed by the 3rd quarter. Yes he’s had some dunks, but he had those in his injury year as well. I’m not saying it’s the abdominal, but it’s not just a generic shooting slump.   His game is mechanically off right now. More passive dribbling into midrange pull-ups than I’ve ever seen him take, no speed going left (his dominant driving lane) and no lift on the layups which allowed him to finish last year at a career high clip. No ability to get separation from defenders with his dribble moves.   Dame used to pull up on every single DHO he got, hair trigger, no hesitation. I don’t think I’ve seen him take more than 1 or 2 any game this season.   Somethings off, get some couples therapy or a Quran or something because if this doesn’t clear up, not surprised if Horst wants to shake shit up.",Loss,like i said in the game thread i’m sure there’s a ton of flaws you can find in griffins coaching and he’s probably not the right guy for the job but when dame looks this bad there’s no point in a deep analysis it’s like trying to diagnose the flu in a gunshot victim i have watched every game of dames career since at least 2014 i have never ever ever seen him play this terribly the only time that came close was the year he had abdominal surgery and i knew from game 1 that year that he wasn’t healthy while the blazers sub called me a crazy hypochondriac that’s what it looks like he’s slow his footwork is completely off his positioning on shots is bad he is completely drenched and gassed by the 3rd quarter yes he’s had some dunks but he had those in his injury year as well i’m not saying it’s the abdominal but it’s not just a generic shooting slump his game is mechanically off right now more passive dribbling into midrange pull-ups than i’ve ever seen him take no speed going left his dominant driving lane and no lift on the layups which allowed him to finish last year at a career high clip no ability to get separation from defenders with his dribble moves dame used to pull up on every single dho he got hair trigger no hesitation i don’t think i’ve seen him take more than 1 or 2 any game this season somethings off get some couples therapy or a quran or something because if this doesn’t clear up not surprised if horst wants to shake shit up,like said game thread ’ sure ’ ton flaws find griffins coaching ’ probably right guy job dame looks bad ’ point deep analysis ’ like trying diagnose flu gunshot victim watched every game dames career since least 2014 never ever ever seen play terribly time came close year abdominal surgery knew game 1 year ’ healthy blazers sub called crazy hypochondriac ’ looks like ’ slow footwork completely positioning shots bad completely drenched gassed 3rd quarter yes ’ dunks injury year well ’ saying ’ abdominal ’ generic shooting slump game mechanically right passive dribbling midrange pull-ups ’ ever seen take speed going left dominant driving lane lift layups allowed finish last year career high clip ability get separation defenders dribble moves dame used pull every single dho got hair trigger hesitation ’ think ’ seen take 1 2 game season somethings get couples therapy quran something ’ clear surprised horst wants shake shit,like said game thread ’ sure ’ ton flaw find griffin coach ’ probabl right guy job dame look bad ’ point deep analysi ’ like tri diagnos flu gunshot victim watch everi game dame career sinc least 2014 never ever ever seen play terribl time came close year abdomin surgeri knew game 1 year ’ healthi blazer sub call crazi hypochondriac ’ look like ’ slow footwork complet posit shot bad complet drench gass 3rd quarter ye ’ dunk injuri year well ’ say ’ abdomin ’ gener shoot slump game mechan right passiv dribbl midrang pull-up ’ ever seen take speed go left domin drive lane lift layup allow finish last year career high clip abil get separ defend dribbl move dame use pull everi singl dho got hair trigger hesit ’ think ’ seen take 1 2 game season someth get coupl therapi quran someth ’ clear surpris horst want shake shit,0

"Few things if you aren't familiar with watching Lillard, he is exceptional at getting to the line when his shot isn't falling, and recognizing (especially in the 4th) when he needs to be driving to create offense because his 3 ball isn't there.  He almost ALWAYS makes the right play.  The Lopez 3 near the end started with Dame driving into the lane, drawing 4 Pistons into the paint, then passing to the perimeter where it went from Payne to Crowder to Lopez for an open 3.

Question do we think they would have won this game with the old roster before dame trade? Giannis had 7 TO which is normal in some games he just turns it over constantly. Usually it's because he has to handle the ball so much with their lack of point guards. Jrue was always more of a combo guard and his value is much higher on defense than offense. When he was asked to carry the load because just the lack of ball handlers he also made some poor shot choices and decisions but they could grind out the games with his defense and the bucks better offensive rebounding give them more chances. I kind of think they would have lost this game with the old roster.

"Yep, one franchise that was willing to do whatever it took to win, and another who's owner died and was taken over by a person who only cared about money, and is inevitably waiting to sell the team after the new TV deal.     Giannis has played with All-Stars, DPOY players, whereas since Dame's second year in the league his best teammate has been CJ, a guy who is basically a carbon copy of Dame with the exact same issues lol.  Dame has never played with another current All-Star since his second year.  I get that Bucks fans haven't watched Dame, but every single Blazers fan I know is flabbergasted by the way Dame is being used on this team, and not one  is surprised he isn't playing well. I used to think Giannis was the best player in the NBA until this year.  Yea, he is the most dominant, but he in no way makes an effort to make his teammates better.  He is physically dominating player that relies on sheer athleticism to crush his opponents, outside of that, he doesn't have anything to offer.  It is why Dame just existing on the court has made Giannis more efficient then he ever has been, but since Giannis refuses to involve himself in a two-man game with Dame, Dame is suffering.  He offers nothing off-ball, and refuses to screen.  Bad combo for Dame.  In the last 6 minutes of tonight's game, I counted ONE screen that Giannis actually set for Dame.  That is completely unacceptable from the supposed best player in the NBA.  We watched the best player in the NBA set screen after screen the other night when Jokic and Murray picked apart the Bucks with their two man game.  Until Giannis learns to treat Dame as an equal, rather then a third option like him and the Bucks are treating him as, this team will go nowhere.",Loss,yep one franchise that was willing to do whatever it took to win and another who's owner died and was taken over by a person who only cared about money and is inevitably waiting to sell the team after the new tv deal giannis has played with all-stars dpoy players whereas since dame's second year in the league his best teammate has been cj a guy who is basically a carbon copy of dame with the exact same issues lol dame has never played with another current all-star since his second year i get that bucks fans haven't watched dame but every single blazers fan i know is flabbergasted by the way dame is being used on this team and not one is surprised he isn't playing well i used to think giannis was the best player in the nba until this year yea he is the most dominant but he in no way makes an effort to make his teammates better he is physically dominating player that relies on sheer athleticism to crush his opponents outside of that he doesn't have anything to offer it is why dame just existing on the court has made giannis more efficient then he ever has been but since giannis refuses to involve himself in a two-man game with dame dame is suffering he offers nothing off-ball and refuses to screen bad combo for dame in the last 6 minutes of tonight's game i counted one screen that giannis actually set for dame that is completely unacceptable from the supposed best player in the nba we watched the best player in the nba set screen after screen the other night when jokic and murray picked apart the bucks with their two man game until giannis learns to treat dame as an equal rather then a third option like him and the bucks are treating him as this team will go nowhere,yep one franchise willing whatever took win another 's owner died taken person cared money inevitably waiting sell team new tv deal giannis played all-stars dpoy players whereas since dame 's second year league best teammate cj guy basically carbon copy dame exact issues lol dame never played another current all-star since second year get bucks fans n't watched dame every single blazers fan know flabbergasted way dame used team one surprised n't playing well used think giannis best player nba year yea dominant way makes effort make teammates better physically dominating player relies sheer athleticism crush opponents outside n't anything offer dame existing court made giannis efficient ever since giannis refuses involve two-man game dame dame suffering offers nothing off-ball refuses screen bad combo dame last 6 minutes tonight 's game counted one screen giannis actually set dame completely unacceptable supposed best player nba watched best player nba set screen screen night jokic murray picked apart bucks two man game giannis learns treat dame equal rather third option like bucks treating team go nowhere,yep one franchis will whatev took win anoth 's owner die taken person care money inevit wait sell team new tv deal gianni play all-star dpoy player wherea sinc dame 's second year leagu best teammat cj guy basic carbon copi dame exact issu lol dame never play anoth current all-star sinc second year get buck fan n't watch dame everi singl blazer fan know flabbergast way dame use team one surpris n't play well use think gianni best player nba year yea domin way make effort make teammat better physic domin player reli sheer athletic crush oppon outsid n't anyth offer dame exist court made gianni effici ever sinc gianni refus involv two-man game dame dame suffer offer noth off-bal refus screen bad combo dame last 6 minut tonight 's game count one screen gianni actual set dame complet unaccept suppos best player nba watch best player nba set screen screen night jokic murray pick apart buck two man game gianni learn treat dame equal rather third option like buck treat team go nowher,0

Home team will always get a favorable whistle & will be allowed to be more physical. Bucks should know this by now & adapt as able.  - Boston played like they were in a game 7 playoff game. Figured they'd play a statement game since they lost last game & barely won the game before that (Memphis?).   - I don't blame AG. Bud would never have given Marjon & AJJ minutes. A lot of the times AG looked frustrated, like he was watching the team thinking wtf are they doing? This isn't how I coached them.   - Dame was pissed. I'm glad.

"Well the frequency of  their two man action is definitely increasing. Their figuring out each others tendencies, how to space around each other when on the ball versus off the ball. Something that's easily noticeable is the increase in alley oops they are connecting on. Previously Dame wouldn't attempt to throw any, then when he attempted, the timing on the pass was off. Now they're successfully connecting from different spots on the court, in different scenarios etc. Its through making mistakes and learning each other tendencies that the chemistry will consistently bear fruit.   Little things like Giannis recognizing that when Lillard drives and may miss a contested layup, the misses come off softly from the rim, so he then in turn knows his timing on crashing for the put-back. Its realizing that when Lillard sucks the defense in on a penetration, knowing when to crash or where to reposition to open the angle for a drop off. It's Dame knowing where to spot up when Giannis post up in case of a double team. Their teammates are also learning how to position and be available from their two man actions, especially the short roll to the elbow/free throw line off a pick and roll. That action alone generates at least 2-3 backdoor looks per game as of late. There are also the instances of Lillard  pulls up for a shot off a DHO, Giannis and Brooke have learned to expect a pass with the expectation of rescreening because Lillard does it often enough. At first, those situations would lead to a turnover where Dame throws the ball at the back of Brooke's head.  With time, they will be torturing defenses consistently like this:   ""Taking turns"" on offense is not a bad thing in  and of itself. Most if not all NBA teams don't come into games with plays drawn up that they want to run  routinely through the 48 mins. There are concepts and actions that form their offensive identity and you want your best players to have the ball in their hands making decisions. The NBA is read and react, it has to be because all teams run the same plays albeit with variations.",Loss,well the frequency of their two man action is definitely increasing their figuring out each others tendencies how to space around each other when on the ball versus off the ball something that's easily noticeable is the increase in alley oops they are connecting on previously dame wouldn't attempt to throw any then when he attempted the timing on the pass was off now they're successfully connecting from different spots on the court in different scenarios etc its through making mistakes and learning each other tendencies that the chemistry will consistently bear fruit little things like giannis recognizing that when lillard drives and may miss a contested layup the misses come off softly from the rim so he then in turn knows his timing on crashing for the put-back its realizing that when lillard sucks the defense in on a penetration knowing when to crash or where to reposition to open the angle for a drop off it's dame knowing where to spot up when giannis post up in case of a double team their teammates are also learning how to position and be available from their two man actions especially the short roll to the elbow/free throw line off a pick and roll that action alone generates at least 2-3 backdoor looks per game as of late there are also the instances of lillard pulls up for a shot off a dho giannis and brooke have learned to expect a pass with the expectation of rescreening because lillard does it often enough at first those situations would lead to a turnover where dame throws the ball at the back of brooke's head with time they will be torturing defenses consistently like this taking turns on offense is not a bad thing in and of itself most if not all nba teams don't come into games with plays drawn up that they want to run routinely through the 48 mins there are concepts and actions that form their offensive identity and you want your best players to have the ball in their hands making decisions the nba is read and react it has to be because all teams run the same plays albeit with variations,well frequency two man action definitely increasing figuring others tendencies space around ball versus ball something 's easily noticeable increase alley oops connecting previously dame would n't attempt throw attempted timing pass 're successfully connecting different spots court different scenarios etc making mistakes learning tendencies chemistry consistently bear fruit little things like giannis recognizing lillard drives may miss contested layup misses come softly rim turn knows timing crashing put-back realizing lillard sucks defense penetration knowing crash reposition open angle drop 's dame knowing spot giannis post case double team teammates also learning position available two man actions especially short roll elbow/free throw line pick roll action alone generates least 2-3 backdoor looks per game late also instances lillard pulls shot dho giannis brooke learned expect pass expectation rescreening lillard often enough first situations would lead turnover dame throws ball back brooke 's head time torturing defenses consistently like taking turns offense bad thing nba teams n't come games plays drawn want run routinely 48 mins concepts actions form offensive identity want best players ball hands making decisions nba read react teams run plays albeit variations,well frequenc two man action definit increas figur other tendenc space around ball versu ball someth 's easili notic increas alley oop connect previous dame would n't attempt throw attempt time pass 're success connect differ spot court differ scenario etc make mistak learn tendenc chemistri consist bear fruit littl thing like gianni recogn lillard drive may miss contest layup miss come softli rim turn know time crash put-back realiz lillard suck defens penetr know crash reposit open angl drop 's dame know spot gianni post case doubl team teammat also learn posit avail two man action especi short roll elbow/fre throw line pick roll action alon gener least 2-3 backdoor look per game late also instanc lillard pull shot dho gianni brook learn expect pass expect rescreen lillard often enough first situat would lead turnov dame throw ball back brook 's head time tortur defens consist like take turn offens bad thing nba team n't come game play drawn want run routin 48 min concept action form offens ident want best player ball hand make decis nba read react team run play albeit variat,0

Or are you telling me the Bucks haven’t set one good screen for Dame the entire year?

I’ve literally seen Dame fire off multiple jumpers with less space off screens against my own team and now it’s like he’s scared to take them regardless.   Giannis has never played with a guy who is so reliant on PnR so his screening is awful no doubt, I hope Doc can figure that out, but I’m not even trying to fault Dame for that. My problem is in those minutes where Giannis isn’t on the floor and he is by far the best player on the court, it’s like he forgets that’s he’s a superstar. I need more aggression. If someone isn’t setting a screen right call him out, if you know you can’t get by a defender call for a screen, if the spacing is off move guys around. He currently has zero killer instinct, he dribbles a few times and if he can’t get by his defender he just gives up and defers to someone else.

"Would just like to point out the major differences I have been calling for that I saw tonight, Dame and Giannis running significantly more 2-man game, has resulted in a bunch of TOs but they are finally working on the chemistry that should've started Game 1 this season. Dame has been running the offense more, not shooting more, and the majority of his shots have been in rhythm for him, not dictated by other people.  There was a sequence I will point out with exactly why Dame needs repeated reps. Three plays in a row in the 4th, Dame gets a screen where Luka is guarding the roller, so two times in a row, Dame blows by him, wide open layup the first, either assist or TO the second. Then the third time Luka backs off and Dame just walks into a 3 that hits nothing but net. That is why Dame is so good. The way he runs those actions reading what the other person is doing, or forcing them to do something else then countering.  Once Dame and Giannis work out some of the kinks in the 2-man game this offense will be unstoppable, timing is off and it will just take reps.  There was an alley oop that Dame threw slightly behind Giannis while he was cutting from the baseline, so Giannis had to land then go up with it.  Soon those will just be highlight dunks.  It is so frustrating we are halfway through the season and there was no emphasis to develop their chemistry under AG....that is his biggest sin.",Win,would just like to point out the major differences i have been calling for that i saw tonight dame and giannis running significantly more 2-man game has resulted in a bunch of tos but they are finally working on the chemistry that should've started game 1 this season dame has been running the offense more not shooting more and the majority of his shots have been in rhythm for him not dictated by other people there was a sequence i will point out with exactly why dame needs repeated reps three plays in a row in the 4th dame gets a screen where luka is guarding the roller so two times in a row dame blows by him wide open layup the first either assist or to the second then the third time luka backs off and dame just walks into a 3 that hits nothing but net that is why dame is so good the way he runs those actions reading what the other person is doing or forcing them to do something else then countering once dame and giannis work out some of the kinks in the 2-man game this offense will be unstoppable timing is off and it will just take reps there was an alley oop that dame threw slightly behind giannis while he was cutting from the baseline so giannis had to land then go up with it soon those will just be highlight dunks it is so frustrating we are halfway through the season and there was no emphasis to develop their chemistry under ag....that is his biggest sin,would like point major differences calling saw tonight dame giannis running significantly 2-man game resulted bunch tos finally working chemistry 've started game 1 season dame running offense shooting majority shots rhythm dictated people sequence point exactly dame needs repeated reps three plays row 4th dame gets screen luka guarding roller two times row dame blows wide open layup first either assist second third time luka backs dame walks 3 hits nothing net dame good way runs actions reading person forcing something else countering dame giannis work kinks 2-man game offense unstoppable timing take reps alley oop dame threw slightly behind giannis cutting baseline giannis land go soon highlight dunks frustrating halfway season emphasis develop chemistry ag .... biggest sin,would like point major differ call saw tonight dame gianni run significantli 2-man game result bunch to final work chemistri 've start game 1 season dame run offens shoot major shot rhythm dictat peopl sequenc point exactli dame need repeat rep three play row 4th dame get screen luka guard roller two time row dame blow wide open layup first either assist second third time luka back dame walk 3 hit noth net dame good way run action read person forc someth els counter dame gianni work kink 2-man game offens unstopp time take rep alley oop dame threw slightli behind gianni cut baselin gianni land go soon highlight dunk frustrat halfway season emphasi develop chemistri ag .... biggest sin,1

On defense he's ball watching and walking around at times/looking at rebounds (being lazy)....which is what most stars do in the NBA but it's relatively new for him.

"Dude, he hit back to back shots in the first minute, then was basically taken out of the offense for the rest of the quarter.  This has been a trend of this Bucks team to let every person have their ""turn"" like it is second grade basketball.  I've watched almost every single one of his games since his rookie season, and the misuse of Dame on this team is insane. Dame isn't Curry, he is not a great off-ball player.  Dame is not Klay, where you can just park him at the 3pt line.  Sure, his gravity will help the team, but it is far away from his best use.  Dame needs to be orchestrating this offense the majority of the time.  He is a rhythm player, the slow start thing for Dame is true to an extent, as he tests the defense, works to get teammates involved, and figures out how he wants to attack.  Once he gets into a rhythm he starts attacking and he is EXCEPTIONAL at that.  But I almost never see Dame play Point Guard more then two plays in a row.  It is baffling how many times I have to watch Dame dribble the ball up the court, and with no action, no screen, no DHO or anything, just pass it to Khris, like this is 90s basketball and all the PG does is dribble the ball up the court.",Loss,dude he hit back to back shots in the first minute then was basically taken out of the offense for the rest of the quarter this has been a trend of this bucks team to let every person have their turn like it is second grade basketball i've watched almost every single one of his games since his rookie season and the misuse of dame on this team is insane dame isn't curry he is not a great off-ball player dame is not klay where you can just park him at the 3pt line sure his gravity will help the team but it is far away from his best use dame needs to be orchestrating this offense the majority of the time he is a rhythm player the slow start thing for dame is true to an extent as he tests the defense works to get teammates involved and figures out how he wants to attack once he gets into a rhythm he starts attacking and he is exceptional at that but i almost never see dame play point guard more then two plays in a row it is baffling how many times i have to watch dame dribble the ball up the court and with no action no screen no dho or anything just pass it to khris like this is 90s basketball and all the pg does is dribble the ball up the court,dude hit back back shots first minute basically taken offense rest quarter trend bucks team let every person turn like second grade basketball 've watched almost every single one games since rookie season misuse dame team insane dame n't curry great off-ball player dame klay park 3pt line sure gravity help team far away best use dame needs orchestrating offense majority time rhythm player slow start thing dame true extent tests defense works get teammates involved figures wants attack gets rhythm starts attacking exceptional almost never see dame play point guard two plays row baffling many times watch dame dribble ball court action screen dho anything pass khris like 90s basketball pg dribble ball court,dude hit back back shot first minut basic taken offens rest quarter trend buck team let everi person turn like second grade basketbal 've watch almost everi singl one game sinc rooki season misus dame team insan dame n't curri great off-bal player dame klay park 3pt line sure graviti help team far away best use dame need orchestr offens major time rhythm player slow start thing dame true extent test defens work get teammat involv figur want attack get rhythm start attack except almost never see dame play point guard two play row baffl mani time watch dame dribbl ball court action screen dho anyth pass khri like 90 basketbal pg dribbl ball court,0
